# Pima Diabetes Analysis

## Description

In this project, we aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions.

    > This project is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. **Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.**
